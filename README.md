C# RSA Example
==================

Example implementation of mCASH RSA signatures in C#


In this example you'll find the MerchantApiKeyAuht class that implements the correct RSA signature scheme for mCASH APIs.

The project also includes a MerchantApiClient class; a minimal implementation of a Merchant API client for demo purposes,
using the MerchantApiKeyAuth class for authentication.
